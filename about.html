<h1>Young Adult or Old Child</h1>
<p>image</p>
<p> As my last year of secondary school races by, and I am being thrust into what many deem “adulthood”, I can’t help but feel my elementary school self talking to me in the back of my head. A 10 year old me fantasizing a full-fledged contributing member of society in a club of well educated and refined men and women and ending up with what one can only describe as a grown child equipped with a beard and anxiety. The cute and innocent backpack with colorful markers and pens replaced with a knapsack of doubt, stress, and medicinal alcohol. The robust and youthful flame from the candle of life and curiosity slowly burning to an ember of old age and maturity. As a business deal transacts from my former adolescence to my future arthritis prone senility, I feel caught as if I am the middleman, overseeing the terms and conditions of this coming to age agreement that I had no prior knowledge of signing. What is a middleman like me to do? Contractually obligated by the tribe that is humankind to fulfill responsibilities, the middleman does what they are expected to: complete the transaction by accepting the piece of paper, rewarded for my strong efforts in 4 years of college, and merge into the post-graduate, capitalistic, world of adulthood.
