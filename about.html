<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<ul><li>I have many loves and passions, including:</li>
    <li>Chess</li>
    <li>Long walks</li>
    <li>Sports</li>
    <li>Family</li>
    <li>Friends</li>
</ul>
<p>As a child, I played basketball and baseball and was extremely competitive. My family and I would go on vacation once a year and I got to see many states and cities. My favorite vacation was when I was in 6th grade and we went to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We enjoyed great food, great weather, and a great view. I hope to one day be able to travel even more and see what the world has to offer.</p>
