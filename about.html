            <p>As a child, I played basketball and baseball and was extremely competitive. My family and I would go on vacation once a year and I got to see many states and cities. My favorite vacation was when I was in 6th grade and we went to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We enjoyed great food, great weather, and a great view. I hope to one day be able to travel even more and see what the world has to offer.</p>

        <h3>Ancedotes</h3>

                3rd grade I came face to face in the bottom of the 9th inning against my best friend. I entered the batters box with a man on third and 1 out in the inning. I looked at him and we both smiled, best friends becoming enemies. I knew the outcome would be bitter sweet either way but I had a team relying on me. The first two pitches came in without a swing, one ball and one strike, both feeling each other out. Then the third pitch. A swing and a sound of metal on leather. The ball went flying into the outfield and the runner from third ran across home plate with his arms up high. We won the game but for that brief moment, lost a friend. We were quick to acknowledge each other after the run scored, shaking hands and once again, best friends.

                It was reshmen year of high school, post homecoming dance at what was deemed an "afterparty" but was more kin to an icebreaker activity at a team retreat. I was messing around with a deck of cards convincing my friend I knew magic. I had him pick a card and return it to the deck while I worked a miracle to try and find it. I reshuffled the deck, threw erroneous cards on the ground and stopped at what felt like the right card. I picked out this card and threw it like a ninja star and it landed completely upright in the nearby refrigerator's ice machine. It was the right card, a complete guess, but the crowd had their jaws on the floor. The eight wonder of the world.
